## Decision requested

Answer the framing questions below freely: this topic's specification
depends on an intention the memory does not state.

## Context

**The project.** <What the project does, and for whom, in one or two sentences, even if the human knows it.>

**The work.** <The goal of the work in progress and why it exists, what is done and what remains; the human's past decisions that lead to it, told by their content and date, not by their number.>

**The question.** <The topic to specify, what the memory already says about it, and what is missing to specify it without guessing.>

## Questions

1. **<An open question.>** Agent's assumption: <what it would assume, or "none">.

## Cited elements

<Each cited element, described in plain words on the spot: never a bare identifier.>

## Where to look

<A link to the backlog topic, and to what the memory says about it.>

What to check: that each question asks for your intention, not for a
choice the agent could make alone.

## Options

- **Answer**: a few minutes, your text in one or several messages, which
  the agent records as is; low risk, the specification follows what you
  want; reversible.
- **Approve the assumptions**: no effort; risk, an assumption that does not
  state your intent, marked "assumed", is corrected later; reversible.
- **Reject**: no effort; risk, the topic waits, without a specification;
  reversible.

## Consequences

If you answer, the agent records your exact text, then writes the
specification or decision that follows from it, and submits it to you in
a request. If you approve the assumptions, it applies them, marked
"assumed". If you reject, the topic waits. If the questions cannot be
understood (`insufficient-context`), the agent rewrites them. Without an
answer, the topic waits too, and the agent works on something else.

## Recommendation

<Approve the assumptions if they state your intention; otherwise answer, even briefly. Verified: what the memory establishes. Assumed: the rest.>

## Possible answers

- `approve` — the agent's assumptions apply, marked "assumed".
- `answers` — your reply's text, in one or several messages, gives the answers; the agent records it as is.
- `reject` — the topic waits, without a specification.
- `insufficient-context` — the request goes back to the agent, which rewrites it as a request that replaces it.
